Hereâ€™s a polished version of your README with the **Figma design link** included and described clearly:

---

# MERN Blog Application

This is a full-stack blog application built with the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js). The project is organized into two main parts: the Backend API server and the Frontend React application.

---

## Technologies Used

### Backend

* Node.js
* Express
* MongoDB with Mongoose
* JWT Authentication
* Cloudinary for image uploads
* Multer for file handling
* Cors, Cookie-parser, Dotenv

### Frontend

* React
* Vite
* Tailwind CSS
* Redux for state management
* React Router for client-side routing
* Vercel for deployment

---

## UI/UX Design

The applicationâ€™s design is inspired by a **modern and responsive blog template** available on Figma:

This design provides:

* A clean, minimal layout with a focus on readability
* Modern typography and responsive grid system
* Ready-to-use blog components such as post cards, featured sections, and categories
* A professional look suitable for both personal and multi-author blogs

## Setup Instructions

### Backend Setup

1. Navigate to the `Backend` directory:

   ```bash
   cd Backend
   ```

2. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Create a `.env` file based on `.env.example` and configure the following environment variables:

   * `PORT` - Port number for the backend server (e.g., 5000)
   * `MONGODB_CONN` - MongoDB connection string
   * `FRONTEND_URL` - URL of the frontend application (for CORS)

4. Run the backend server in development mode:

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

   Or to start normally:

   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

The backend server will start and listen on the specified port.

---

### Frontend Setup

The frontend is a React application built with Vite. For detailed setup and running instructions, please refer to the [Frontend README](./Frontend/README.md).

In summary:

1. Navigate to the `Frontend` directory:

   ```bash
   cd Frontend
   ```

2. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Create a `.env` file based on `.env.example` and configure environment variables as needed.

4. Run the development server:

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

The frontend app will be available at `http://localhost:3000` by default.

---

## Environment Variables

Both backend and frontend use environment variables for configuration. Make sure to create `.env` files in both directories based on the provided `.env.example` files.

Important backend variables:

* `PORT`
* `MONGODB_CONN`
* `FRONTEND_URL`

Important frontend variables:

* Refer to `Frontend/.env.example`

---

## Running the Application

To run the full application locally, start both backend and frontend servers concurrently in separate terminal windows:

* Backend: `npm run dev` in `Backend` folder
* Frontend: `npm run dev` in `Frontend` folder

---

## Deployment

This project is configured for deployment on [Vercel](https://vercel.com/) with configuration files in both `Backend/vercel.json` and `Frontend/vercel.json`.

Do you want me to **add a screenshot preview from that Figma design into the README** too? That usually makes the README pop and gives contributors/users an instant visual reference.
